Objectives

I.Identify possible problems students might be facing while writing these exams  bearing in mind that this would involve starting from the scratch as most schools do not have the foundational data infrastructure to solve this problem.  

II.Generate your data through any means based on the needs of your solution while ensuring that your data adequately reflects the state of the African education ecosystem

III.Design an enterprise data solution for the school’s data collection, pipelining, warehousing, automation and reporting needs.

IV.Create an optimised model that predicts the likelihood of a student passing or failing their upcoming exam based on their academic history. Consider all factors that could affect a student's upcoming result aside from their previous exam scores.

V.Make relevant recommendations to the Stakeholders on how they can help improve the performance of the students based on your solution



OUR SOLUTION

a)Simulate a Dataset Based on Education System in Akure

To simulate a realistic dataset based on the education system in Akure, Nigeria, we designed it to reflect key attributes that affect students' performance in JAMB and WASSCE. The dataset  include students' academic data, demographics, environmental factors, and other important metrics based on current trends in secondary education in Nigeria.


 Key Data Points to Include:
1. Student Demographics:
   
 Age (range: 15-19 years for SS3 students)
  Gender
  
   Socioeconomic Status (Low, Medium, High)
   
   Parental Education (None, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)

3. Academic Data:
   
  Continuous Assessment Scores (1st term, 2nd term, 3rd term) for core subjects: Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry, and a choice of a 5th subject (e.g., Biology, Government, Literature)
  
   Attendance Percentage
   
   Final Exam Scores in mock exams leading up to JAMB/WASSCE

5. Environmental Factors:
   
    Access to Learning Resources (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
   
   Teacher Qualification (Unqualified, Qualified, Highly Qualified)
   
   School Infrastructure Quality (Low, Medium, High)
   
   Access to Electricity (Hours per day)
   
    Classroom Size (Number of students per class)

4.Extracurricular Involvement:

  Participation in extracurricular activities (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  
  Type of extracurricular activities (Sports, Clubs, None)

5. Psychological Factors:
   
  Stress Levels (Low, Medium, High)
  
   Test Anxiety (Low, Medium, High)
   
  Motivation Level (Low, Medium, High)

7. External Exam Results:
   
   JAMB Score (out of 400)
   
    WAEC Score (aggregated score based on 5 subjects)
   
    Predictive Output: Likelihood of passing (Pass/Fail based on score thresholds)


b) Data Analysis

Objective: Identify key factors affecting student performance.

Analysis Techniques:

    Descriptive statistics to understand distribution (average scores, pass rates).
    
     - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between factors (e.g., study time and performance).
     
     - Regression analysis to predict how different variables influence exam scores.

c)Model Development 

Built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of student passing or failing an upcoming examination
